# We will automatically create dtags and private keys based on the identifier variable in main.
# If your DVM already has a dtag and private key you can replace it here before publishing the DTAG to not create a new one.
# The name and NIP90 info of the DVM can be changed but the identifier must stay the same in order to not create a different dtag.

# We will also create new wallets on the given lnbits instance for each dvm. If you want to use an existing wallet, you can replace the parameters here as well.
# Make sure you backup this file to keep access to your wallets
